This is the first project I completed as part of the Odin Project webd development course. 
The directions were to recreate the google homepage. 
The difficulty was listed as "easy" but this took me about 10 hours starting over about 3 times total.

I am quite happy with the result, and would love to hear any constructive feedback you might have or tips for improvement. 


Thank you for checkiing this out :)
