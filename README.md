This is the first project I completed as part of the Odin Project full-stack web development course. 
The goal was to recreate the Google homepage using HTML and CSS only (no JS). 

I'm quite happy with the result, and would love to hear any constructive feedback you might have or tips for improvement. 

Thank you for checking this out :)
